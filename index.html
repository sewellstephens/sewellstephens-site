The code for CSS file, index.html will look something like this: The background will be black and the terminal text will be white.

Let’s code a portfolio website that looks like a Terminal.

Are you a coder? Do you enjoy programming? Have you ever used Terminal? Do you wish to have a portfolio website that looks like a Terminal?

Well, this is what we are going to make in this article.

Let’s start with the result itself, what we are going to build here, is what I use for my creative portfolio website. Go and check the following link out, Open the following link in a new tab, I’ll wait…

It looks like this.

Don’t want to go to a new link? You’ll miss something great, but anyways here is the image.

Did you like it? Want to build this for yourself? Then read along…

So this is my personal website portfolio that I’ve hosted on GitHub Pages. You can also host it on GitHub Pages, or you can use another service that deploys your code from GitHub (for free!), like Netlify.

If you want to use GitHub Pages, then, go to GitHub, make a new repository and name it as [your-username].github.io .

You have to put your own username in the above bracket, which is case sensitive too.

If you don’t want to use GitHub Pages, then you can name the repository whatever you want.

Now let’s get into some code.
First let’s make HTML file for your web-page. The html code is very simple to understand, as the most of the magic that we will do, is in JavaScript or CSS.

I’ve named the file, index.html for this. The code will be like this:

<html> 
  <head> 
    <title>CodeNerve</title> 
    <script type="text/javascript"  src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js"></script> 
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="index.css">
  </head> 
  <body> 
    <script type="text/javascript" src="index.js"> 
    </script> 
    <div id="console"></div> 
    <script type="text/javascript", src="index2.js">
    </script>
  </body> 
</html>
